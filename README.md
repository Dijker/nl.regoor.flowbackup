# Flow Backup app for Homey

Backup and restore your flows to and from a file. You can select which flows from your backup you want to restore.
You can use the app to copy flows as well.
Warning: use this app at your own risk. The app is intended as a temporary solution, until Athom offers a built-in backup function.
